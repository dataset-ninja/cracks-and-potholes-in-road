**Cracks and Potholes in Road Images** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the utilities and safety industries. 

The dataset consists of 2235 images with 4720 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *road*, *cracks*, and *pothole*.

Images in the Cracks and Potholes in Road dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the [Universidade do Vale do Itajai, Brazil](https://www.univali.br/Paginas/default.aspx) and [DNIT, Brazil](https://www.gov.br/dnit/pt-br).
