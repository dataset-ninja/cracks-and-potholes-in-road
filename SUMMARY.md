**Cracks and Potholes in Road Images** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the utilities and safety industries. 

The dataset consists of 2235 images with 4720 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *road*, *cracks*, and *pothole*.

Images in the Cracks and Potholes in Road dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Universidade do Vale do Itajai, Brazil and DNIT, Brazil.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
